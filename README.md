How to compile code?
--------------------
This code uses Python3. The python code file imports the following libraries:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. math
5. PyWavelets (pywt)
6. sklearn
7. statsmodels
8. scipy
9. seaborn

They can be installed by using the following commands:
1. pip install numpy
2. pip install pandas
3. pip install matplotlib
4. <math is in-built as far as i know. couldn't find the code online>
5. pip install PyWavelets
6. pip install sklearn
7. pip install statsmodels
8. pip install scipy
9. pip install seaborn

Compile & Run the code using the command "python <File-Path>/Final.py"

Note# If your system has both Python2 & Python3, use pip3 instead of pip & python3 instead of python to compile.
